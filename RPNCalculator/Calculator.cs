     * @class Calculator        implementation of a reverse polish notation calculator
     * 
     * This class contains the logic and data structure for:
     * - Maintaining a stack of decimals to hold the operands
     * - Identify commands associated with known operators and dispatch appropriate handler
     * - Any input that is not identified as a command will be treated as numeric input to be pushed onto the stack
     * - If input cannot be interpreted as a valid command or decimal an exception is thrown
     * 
     * To use this class, create an instance of it and call ProcessUserInput with every input provided by user
