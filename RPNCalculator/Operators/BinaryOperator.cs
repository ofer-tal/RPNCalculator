     * @class BinaryOperator      Base class for a single Binary operator handler for RPN Calculator (takes 2 operands)

     * This abstract class is the suggested base class for all RPNCalculator binary operators.
     * It implements the stack operations common to all binary operators (pop 2 operands, calculate and push the result)
     * and leaves a new abstract Calculate() method (different signature) for specific Binary operators to implement.
     * 
     * Implement binary operators by providing an implementation of the Calculate and the IsTriggeringInput abstract methods and register the operator in the operators list of the Calculator class.
